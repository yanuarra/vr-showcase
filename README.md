# TCO VR Showcase

## Getting started
AR Human Anatomy Showcase is an interactive augmented reality app that brings the human body through detailed 3D organ models. Users can explore each organ up close, view in-depth anatomical information, and test their knowledge with quizzes. The built-in scoring system tracks progress and encourages learning, making it ideal for students, educators, and health enthusiasts alike.
